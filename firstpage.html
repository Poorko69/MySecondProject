          <br>  for food, water, weapons, and medicine, while killing or avoiding the infected, and killing, avoiding, or
           <br> cooperating with other players in an effort to survive the outbreak.
          
        <br>  DayZ began development in 2012 when the mod's creator, Dean Hall, joined Bohemia Interactive to commence work on
        <br>   the standalone version of the game. The development has been focused on altering the engine to suit
          <br>  the game's needs, developing a working client-server architecture, and introducing new features like diseases
          <br>  and a better inventory system. The game sold over three million copies during its early access phase.</p></h3>
